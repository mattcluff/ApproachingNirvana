        <h2>Band Bio</h2>
        
        <p id="bio"> 
            Approaching Nirvana started as an electronic/orchestral producing duo consisting of Sam Wilson and Andrew Sinclair in 2009. 
            The two met each other on "NewGrounds" (an internet website that describes themselves as "A community of artists, 
            game developers, musicians, voice actors and writers who create and share some of the best stuff on the web!"). The two eventually
            collaborated via Skype to create a song. It wouldn't be another 3 years until they met in person in Miama, Florida in 2012 to begin 
            production of their music on a larger scale. 
            
        <br>
        <br>

            From 2012 to 2015 they produced 8 albums together. This was considered the golden era for the group and their YouTube Channel
            largely because of their easy going approach to allowing anybody to use their music on YouTube for their own videos so long as the 
            band was credited properly. Several millions of views later and after several successful singles and albums, Sam Wilson left in 2016 
            to start his own label, but Andrew Sinclair continues to this day producing music under the Approaching Nirvana YouTube Channel. 
            Ever since the group disbanded, their YouTube channel gets nowhere near the amount of video views as it did in it's prime.

        <br>
          
            Despite Approaching Nirvana's fading popularity, tens of thousands return each year to some of their greatest hits. Whether you
            love their high intensity pump-you-up songs like "Sugar High", beautiful voice collaborated tracks such as "Aim for Me", or some of their more chill music like "I Dream of Ibiza", you're bound to find
            out of their over 350 songs something that your ears will love.
